Implement a program that compares two files for similarities.

Implement a website that highlights similarities across files, a la the below.

Determining whether two files are identical is (relatively!) trivial: iterate over the characters in each, checking whether each and every one is identical. But determining whether two files are similar is non-trivial. After all, what does it mean to be similar? Perhaps the files have lines in common. Perhaps the files have sentences in common. Perhaps the files have only substrings in common.

Suffice it to say, the challenge ahead is to determine if two files are similar!
